// Instructions
// This challenge, youâ€™ll write a function, called best, that returns the maximum profit possible for buying-and-selling a stock.

// The best function will be given an array of stock prices in the order they happened throughout the day.

// It should return the maximum possible profit on the stock for that day.

// For example, with the following prices, our best option would have been to buy the stock at $10 and sell it at $22. So the profit would be $12:

// best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9])
// 12
// Here are some more examples with positive profit:

// best([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
// // 4 - buy at $1, sell at $5

// best([2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1])
// // 8 - buy at $2, sell at $10

// best([7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2])
// 2 - buy at $7, sell at $9

// best([0, 100])
// 100 - buy at $0, sell at $100
// If no profit is possible, return $0:

// best([5, 4 , 3, 2, 1])
// // 0

// best([100])
// // 0

// best([100, 0])

function best(arr) {
   
    let profit = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++){
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++){
            if (arr[j] - arr[i] > profit) {
                profit = arr[j] - arr[i]
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(profit)
}
best([7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2]) 
best([2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1])
